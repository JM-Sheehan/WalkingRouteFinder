# WalkingRouteFinder(Java)
<b>Java Application</b> for college, that calculates walking routes between landmarks in Waterford City.

This Application makes use of a purely text based UI.
Through this project I have covered topics including designing a <b>Graph based data structure</b>, used to link Landmarks represented in an abstract data type.
I have then used <b>FXML</b> to add an element of persistence between concurrent uses of the app.
